# Cannabis Order Dashboard

Initial repository setup for the ordering dashboard per Batch 1.2 of the execution plan.

Structure:
- `index.html` – base HTML page
- `assets/` – static assets (CSS/JS)
- `data/` – data files (e.g., `LiveMenu.xlsx`, generated JSON later)
- `orderSubmit.php` – server-side form handler (stub)

Next steps:
- Verify Node.js, npm, and PHP are installed
- Create and link GitHub repository (private)
- Create `dev` branch for staging
