Understood. I will produce a complete, executable XML plan based on the deployment PDF, using best-in-class and long-term sustainable approaches. This includes the build-step JSON generation method, staging and production environments, and an English-only interface.

Iâ€™ll return the full XML Execution Plan shortly.

            <Command>Create a new private GitHub repository (e.g., cannabis-order-dashboard) to host the project code and data. Initialize it with a README and appropriate .gitignore (include Node.js, PHP, and OS artifacts like node_modules/, vendor/, .env).</Command>
            <Command>Organize the repository structure: create directories for key components, e.g., /data (for LiveMenu.xlsx and output JSON), /assets (for compiled CSS or images). Place PHP scripts at the root or in a php/ directory (for simplicity in deployment).</Command>
            <Command>Add placeholder files: an empty LiveMenu.xlsx in /data; a basic index.html with a title and structural HTML; an empty orderSubmit.php file for the form handler; and stub JavaScript/CSS files (if needed) linked in the HTML.</Command>

          <Commands>
            <Command>Design the layout of the ordering dashboard: include sections for product listings (populated from the menu JSON) and an order form for user details and selected products. Use semantic HTML5 elements (header, main, form, section) for accessibility.</Command>
            <Command>Integrate Tailwind CSS for styling: initialize Tailwind by installing it (npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer) and creating a Tailwind config (npx tailwindcss init). Configure the content paths to include HTML and PHP files for purge (to remove unused styles).</Command>
            <Command>Create a CSS entry file (e.g., assets/tailwind.css) with Tailwind directives (@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;). Add a build step or use PostCSS to compile this to assets/styles.css. Update the package.json "build" script to also run Tailwind, e.g., "build:css": "tailwindcss -i assets/tailwind.css -o assets/styles.css --minify", and combine it with the data conversion (e.g., "build": "tailwindcss -i assets/tailwind.css -o assets/styles.css --minify &amp;&amp; node convertMenu.js").</Command>
            <Command>Apply Tailwind utility classes in the HTML for a responsive design (e.g., use grid or flex classes for layout, spacing classes for padding/margin, typography classes for font sizes). Incorporate responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) to adjust the layout for mobile vs desktop as needed.</Command>
            <Command>Ensure the UI is mobile-first and responsive: include the viewport meta (&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;) and test the layout at various screen sizes. Utilize Tailwind's default responsive breakpoints (sm, md, lg, etc.) to hide, stack, or resize elements on smaller screens appropriately.</Command>
          </Commands>
          <Verification>Open index.html in a web browser and use dev tools to simulate different screen widths. Verify that the layout adjusts (e.g., menu items stack in a single column on mobile vs grid on desktop) and no horizontal scroll appears. All text is legible without zoom, and interactive elements (buttons, form fields) are appropriately sized on mobile. Check that the compiled assets/styles.css is loaded and contains Tailwind utility styles (inspect elements to see Tailwind classes applied).</Verification>
          <RollBack>If the Tailwind setup fails (e.g., CSS not applying or build errors), revert CSS changes and use the Tailwind CDN as a temporary fallback (by adding &lt;script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"&gt; in HTML) while troubleshooting. If the UI is not responsive or has layout issues, adjust the Tailwind classes or breakpoints and retest; if necessary, revert to a simpler layout and build up again in smaller increments to isolate problematic styles.</RollBack>

            <Command>Add a script to fetch and render the product menu from menu.json. For example, include an assets/menu.js file and load it via a &lt;script&gt; tag at the bottom of index.html.</Command>
            <Command>In assets/menu.js, use the Fetch API to retrieve data/menu.json (assuming it's deployed as static content). On success, dynamically create HTML elements or use a template to insert each product into the product list section (e.g., generate list items or cards with name, description, price). Ensure this runs after the DOM is loaded (place script at end of body or use DOMContentLoaded event).</Command>
            <Command>Implement basic error handling for data load (e.g., if fetch fails, display an error message or fallback content so the page isn't blank).</Command>
            <Command>If the menu data is small and fairly static, consider embedding it directly by inlining a &lt;script type="application/json" id="menu-data"&gt; containing the JSON to avoid an extra fetch; however, using a separate file allows easier updates and caching. Ensure appropriate caching (to be configured later) so updates propagate in a timely manner.</Command>

          <Verification>Load the page in a local or staging environment and confirm that product entries appear on the page, matching the content of LiveMenu.xlsx. Use the browser dev tools network panel to ensure menu.json is requested and loaded (HTTP 200). Check the console for any JavaScript errors and confirm none occur.</Verification>
          <RollBack>If the data does not display, use dev tools to diagnose (check console for script errors, ensure the menu.json path is correct and the JSON is accessible in the deployed environment). If fetch is failing due to path issues, adjust the path or ensure the JSON is included in the deployment output. As a quick rollback, hardcode a few sample products in the HTML so the page isn't empty, then fix the dynamic loading for a future commit (removing the hardcoded entries once the dynamic load works).</RollBack>

            <Command>Create an order form within index.html for users to submit orders or inquiries. Include fields such as customer name, contact info (email/phone), and an order details field or product selection. Mark required fields with the required attribute and use appropriate input types (e.g., &lt;input type="email"&gt; for email).</Command>
            <Command>Add client-side validation using HTML5 and/or JavaScript: for example, ensure the email field contains a valid email format (browser default validation covers basics), ensure no required field is empty, and potentially validate that an order detail or product selection is provided.</Command>
            <Command>Implement a simple spam prevention mechanism: include a hidden honeypot field in the form (e.g., &lt;input type="text" name="company" style="display:none"&gt;). Real users will leave it blank (it's invisible); bots often fill all fields, so if this field comes back with content, the submission can be identified as spam and ignored.</Command>
            <Command>Write a bit of JavaScript to enhance validation and spam check if needed: on form submit, check that the honeypot field is empty (indicating a human user). Optionally disable the submit button upon click to prevent duplicate submissions, and provide user feedback (like a loading indicator or message) while awaiting response.</Command>
          </Commands>
          <Verification>Attempt to submit the form in various scenarios: leave required fields blank to confirm browser/JS validation prevents submission; enter an invalid email to see a validation message; fill the honeypot via dev tools and ensure the form either does not submit or the server will catch it (to be verified in server-side logic). For a valid submission (honeypot empty, all required fields filled with valid data), ensure the form proceeds to submission (which will be handled by the PHP script).</Verification>
          <RollBack>If client-side validation is not functioning, ensure the script is correctly referenced and that no JS errors are thrown. If needed, rely on HTML5 validation alone by using proper input types and required attributes to block bad inputs. If the honeypot approach appears insufficient (some advanced bots might bypass it), plan to introduce a stronger measure (like reCAPTCHA) in the future; for now, proceed while monitoring for spam submissions post-launch.</RollBack>

Commit composer.json and composer.lock (but not the vendor/ directory) to the repo, as dependencies will be installed during deployment.</Command>
            <Command>Implement orderSubmit.php: this PHP script will handle the form POST request. Start by loading PHPMailer (e.g., include Composer's autoload with require 'vendor/autoload.php';). Retrieve and sanitize form fields from $_POST (use filter_input or htmlspecialchars to avoid XSS or email header injection).</Command>
            <Command>Check the honeypot field server-side: if the hidden field (e.g., $_POST['company']) is not empty, treat the submission as spam and do not send an email (optionally log or silently discard).</Command>

Set SMTP server (Host), enable SMTPAuth, set Username and Password from environment variables, choose SMTPSecure (TLS) and Port (e.g., 587).

Common issues include incorrect SMTP credentials or ports, or host firewalls blocking the connection. Temporarily adjust settings (e.g., try a different SMTP server or enable less secure app access if using Gmail for testing) to identify the issue. As a fallback, allow the form to submit and display a message like "We will contact you to confirm your order" (so that the business can manually handle it) until the email issue is resolved.

Include a timestamp and the key fields (but avoid sensitive personal data beyond what is needed for order fulfillment). Use file\_put\_contents in append mode or similar mechanism.</Command> <Command>Secure the log and data files: update the web server configuration (.htaccess for Apache on IONOS) to prevent public access to sensitive files in /data.

Continue to validate and sanitize all inputs on the server side (for example, use filter\_var for emails, and limit input lengths) to reduce risk of malicious input causing issues.</Command> <Command>Test the logging and security: after a test form submission, verify that an entry was added to data/orders.log on the server (accessible via SFTP or IONOS file browser). Attempt to access LiveMenu.xlsx or orders.log via a browser (e.g., [https://staging.example.com/data/LiveMenu.xlsx](https://staging.example.com/data/LiveMenu.xlsx)) to ensure the server responds with 403 Forbidden or similar, confirming the .htaccess rules are working.</Command> </Commands> <Verification>Ensure that data/orders.log contains the expected entry after a test submission and that no sensitive info (like passwords) is logged. Accessing any .xlsx or .log file via HTTP should be blocked (forbidden response). Also, review phpinfo or IONOS settings to confirm display\_errors is off in production environment.</Verification> <RollBack>If log entries are not appearing, check file permissions on data/orders.log (the PHP process may need write permission). Adjust if needed (IONOS environments typically allow writing to project files by default). If the .htaccess rule is misconfigured and blocks needed files or isn't working, correct it (make sure AllowOverride is on for that directory, and syntax is right). In an urgent scenario, temporarily remove or rename the sensitive files until proper rules are in place.

The CI/CD workflow run for dev should be visible in GitHub Actions (mirroring the main pipeline steps).</Command> <Command>Test the staging site: open the preview URL. It should be an exact copy of the site but on a different domain. Use this for final QA tests.

The redirect from HTTP to HTTPS works properly (HTTP URLs get 301 redirected).</Verification> <RollBack>If HTTPS is not working (e.g., certificate not issued or has errors), do not enforce redirect until resolved. Continue to troubleshoot domain linking or certificate issuance (check if domain is properly pointed, or if Let's Encrypt challenge failed possibly due to DNS). Contact IONOS support if needed. If for some reason HTTPS cannot be enabled by launch, communicate with the client about the risk and possibly use the IONOS provided domain (which has SSL) temporarily.

Similarly, if an analytics or search console setup is needed, add the new domain (register it in Google Search Console for example, to monitor indexing).</Command> <Command>Ensure the client has control over the domain's DNS (especially if we changed nameservers). If the domain was external and moved, verify with the client that email or other DNS records for that domain are unaffected (if the domain had other services, those DNS entries must be replicated in IONOS DNS).</Command> <Command>Document the domain setup: record what DNS changes were made and how the TLS is managed (so future maintainers know that TLS is auto-handled by IONOS).

Then verify that on submission, a success confirmation is shown (either a thank-you page or message) and no error is visible to the user.</Command> <Command>Check that a test order submission results in an email being sent to the configured address (or test address). Ensure the email content matches the form input. Also verify that an order log entry was created if logging is enabled.</Command> <Command>Validate spam protection: attempt a submission with the honeypot field filled (manually via browser dev tools) and confirm that such submission does not trigger an email and is perhaps logged differently or ignored.</Command> <Command>Conduct negative tests: try to break the form by inputting script tags or SQL keywords in fields to see if any vulnerability is present (they should just be treated as plain text in the email/log). Ensure no part of the system is exposing stack traces or sensitive information when given bad inputs.</Command> </Commands> <Verification>All critical functionality works on staging: The menu is correct and up-to-date. The form can be submitted successfully and results in an email to the test inbox (with correct details and formatting). Validation prevents bad input, and spam submissions are ignored. No security issues are evident (malicious inputs do not cause any obvious issues).</Verification> <RollBack>If any issues are discovered, fix them before production launch. For example, if the email format is wrong or missing info, adjust orderSubmit.php to include it. If validation is inadequate, improve the JS or add server checks. If any part of the flow fails (no email received, etc.), debug on staging until resolved.

Ensure the layout is consistent and there are no browser-specific errors in the console.</Command> <Command>Run a performance test (using Google PageSpeed Insights or Lighthouse on the staging URL). Check metrics like First Contentful Paint and overall performance score. The site is static so it should be fast; verify Tailwind CSS is optimized (thanks to purge, the CSS file should not be huge). Ensure images (if any) are optimized and that there's no render-blocking issues beyond a minimal CSS.</Command> <Command>Verify caching: ensure that static assets (CSS, JS, JSON) are being cached by the browser. Use dev tools to inspect response headers for Cache-Control on these files. If not present or not optimal, plan to add headers (like a long max-age for CSS/JS and maybe a short one for JSON if we want frequent update checks).</Command> <Command>Test resilience: if possible, simulate a scenario of high load (though not easy without tools - even just opening multiple tabs or using online load test services lightly since it's static). Everything should still function due to the static nature of the site and email being the only dynamic part (which could be a bottleneck if too many come at once, but not likely at initial scale).</Command> <Command>Verify that updating the Excel and redeploying would reflect changes properly (this is more of a process test): update something minor in LiveMenu.xlsx (like a product name), go through the commit and deploy on staging, and ensure the change appears on the staging site. This validates our update process and CI pipeline end-to-end one more time.</Command> </Commands> <Verification>The site scores well in performance tests (e.g., high 90s in Lighthouse for performance). No major differences across browsers; all features work on mobile (touch interactions, form input, etc.). Caching is appropriately applied (repeat visits load faster due to cached assets, but data updates still propagate because either JSON is not heavily cached or we will manage cache-busting). The Excel update test shows that content changes flow through the pipeline and show up on the site as expected.</Verification> <RollBack>If performance is subpar, consider enabling compression (IONOS likely already serves gzip/Brotli). Remove any unnecessary large scripts (not expected here). If caching is not as desired, adjust .htaccess to set Cache-Control headers (for example, long max-age for static assets like CSS/JS, and maybe no-cache or a short max-age for menu.json to ensure fresh data on each visit). Document any such changes and test again. Ensure these adjustments do not negatively impact functionality (e.g., too aggressive caching of JSON could show stale menu; mitigate by versioning if necessary).</RollBack> </Step> <Step id="5.1.3"> <Task>Perform security assessment on staging</Task> <OwnerRoles> <Role>Security Engineer</Role> <Role>QA Engineer</Role> </OwnerRoles> <Commands> <Command>Review the site for common security issues. Use browser developer tools to ensure no sensitive data is exposed in the source (e.g., search the rendered HTML and JS for any leftover API keys or secretsâ€”there should be none since we use env variables).</Command> <Command>Test for XSS: input something like "\<script>alert('xss')\</script>" in form fields (name or order details) and submit. The script tags should appear literally in the received email or log (since we encode or treat as plain text), and should not execute anywhere on the site. Since the site itself doesn't display submitted data, XSS risk is minimal on frontend; the main risk would be if an admin opens the log in a browser without sanitizing, but the log is text.</Command> <Command>Ensure HTTP headers for security are in place: check responses for headers like X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN, Content-Security-Policy, etc. IONOS might set some by default. If any are missing and desired, plan to add them via .htaccess (e.g., Header set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"). CSP might be liberal (since it's a simple site, you can set a strict CSP allowing only self, perhaps).</Command> <Command>Examine the form submission process: ensure that it is only accessible via the site (we may not have explicit CSRF protection because there's no session, but the obscurity and one-time nature might be acceptable; however, note this risk). Since it's a public form, CSRF isn't a big issue (anyone can submit anyway), but we should confirm no misuses (like email header injectionâ€”our PHPMailer usage should handle that). We already validated against header injection by not directly using mail() and by sanitizing inputs.</Command> <Command>Optionally, run a vulnerability scan using a tool like OWASP ZAP on the staging site. This can catch any missed issues (like missing security headers or potential injection points). Address any high or medium findings from such a scan.</Command> </Commands> <Verification>No security vulnerabilities are identified. The test script injection appears harmless in the email/log (not executed in any context). The site does not reveal any secret info. Security headers are present or have been added as needed (no glaring omissions). The OWASP ZAP report (if run) shows no serious issues, or any minor ones have been acknowledged and mitigated.</Verification> <RollBack>If any vulnerabilities are found, fix them before production push. For example, if CSP is missing and considered necessary, add one (be careful to not break any functionality; in our case, maybe allow 'self' and inline styles if any, etc.). If security headers like X-Frame-Options are missing, add them. If any form of injection seems possible, double down on input sanitization or output encoding. The rollback here is essentially delaying launch until issues are fixed; do not proceed to production with known security issues if at all possible. If a critical issue is discovered after launch, take the site offline (disable form or whole page) until a fix is deployed.</RollBack> </Step> </Batch> <Batch id="5.2" name="Production Launch Verification"> <Step id="5.2.1"> <Task>Deploy to production and smoke test</Task> <OwnerRoles> <Role>DevOps Engineer</Role> <Role>Project Manager</Role> </OwnerRoles> <Commands> <Command>Merge the dev (staging) branch into main (production) once all tests are passed and approved.

All references now point to the production domain, and users are using the live site.</Verification> <RollBack>If any critical issue is discovered on production (that somehow slipped through staging), immediately decide on a rollback: either fix forward if trivial (small configuration tweak) or roll back to previous deployment. Rolling back on IONOS could mean redeploying an earlier commit or temporarily reverting the main branch to a known good commit and letting CI deploy that. If the issue is domain related or emailing, and cannot be fixed in minutes, consider putting up a maintenance page (even a simple static "We'll be back soon" page) to pause orders until resolved.

If it's a minor tweak (text change, etc.), it can go through a quick fix directly on production (with stakeholder approval). If itâ€™s more substantial, treat it as a new change request (see ChangeControl) and possibly roll back the feature (if possible) while reworking it.

For example, if a new product was added in Excel, it now shows up on the site; if a price was changed, the new price is displayed. No layout issues or errors result from the update (the JSON format remained consistent and the front-end handles the new data gracefully).</Verification> <RollBack>If an update causes an issue (e.g., someone accidentally deleted a column in Excel, causing the JSON conversion to break or produce malformed data), immediately roll back to the previous version: retrieve the last good LiveMenu.xlsx from version control and redeploy it. Then fix the Excel file (re-add the column or correct data) and go through the deployment again. The version control history serves as a backup for all past menu states, so you can always revert to a known working state quickly.</RollBack> </Step> <Step id="6.2.2"> <Task>Enhance caching strategy for updated data</Task> <OwnerRoles> <Role>DevOps Engineer</Role> <Role>Front-End Developer</Role> </OwnerRoles> <Commands> <Command>Ensure that when menu data updates, users get the new data promptly. If menu.json is cached by browsers, consider implementing cache-busting: for example, include a version query parameter when fetching (like data/menu.json?v=2025-08-13 or a commit hash) that changes on each deployment, so browsers always fetch the latest.</Command> <Command>Alternatively, set a short cache duration for menu.json. Using .htaccess, one could add Header set Cache-Control "max-age=60, must-revalidate" for the JSON file, meaning browsers will re-fetch it after a minute. The rest of the static assets (CSS, JS) can have a longer cache since they change infrequently and can use content hash if needed.</Command> <Command>Monitor if users or staff report seeing stale data after updates. If so, instruct them to hard refresh as a workaround and prioritize implementing the above cache-busting solutions. Over time, refine the caching configuration to balance freshness and performance.</Command> <Command>Document the caching behavior in the runbook so that during updates, the team knows what to expect (e.g., "once deployed, all users will get new menu within X minutes or on next page load due to cache settings" or "we increment the version query so they always get it immediately").</Command> </Commands> <Verification>After implementing these strategies, when a new menu is deployed, even users with cached sites receive the updated menu the next time they access the site without needing a full hard refresh. Testing using developer tools (disable cache and normal mode) shows the JSON is often fetched anew. This ensures the business information is always current for customers.</Verification> <RollBack>If the cache-busting introduction inadvertently breaks something (for example, if an older deployment's front-end tries to fetch a versioned file that doesn't exist yet), be ready to adjust. Perhaps deploy the front-end code that adds ?v=timestamp slightly before deploying the data change, so there's no mismatch. In any case, if caching causes issues, one can temporarily set menu.json to no-cache (so every visit pulls fresh data) as a safe but slightly less optimized solution until a more robust strategy is in place.</RollBack> </Step> </Batch> <Batch id="6.3" name="Continuous Improvement and Change Management"> <Step id="6.3.1"> <Task>Review and address identified risks periodically</Task> <OwnerRoles> <Role>Project Manager</Role> <Role>Security Engineer</Role> </OwnerRoles> <Commands> <Command>Periodically (e.g., monthly), review the RisksRegister below. For each risk, assess if it's becoming an issue or if mitigation measures are holding. E.g., check spam submission logs to see if honeypot is effectively deterring bots or if a lot of spam still comes through (which might prompt adding reCAPTCHA).</Command> <Command>Update risk statuses: if some risk has been eliminated or reduced (for instance, if the site gets integrated with a more robust system later, maybe some risks go away), note that. Add any new risks that arise (maybe "email account quota" if volume grows, or "compliance changes" if laws change).</Command> <Command>Ensure risk mitigations are tested: e.g., do a quick test that the order email account password is still valid (maybe set a reminder to change it periodically for security, which then needs updating in secrets). For the security risk of outdated dependencies, keep PHPMailer and Node packages updated via periodic maintenance updates.</Command> <Command>Share a summary of risk status with the team and client as appropriate, especially for high-impact risks. This keeps everyone aware and prepared (for instance, if "Email deliverability" is a risk, the business might consider also regularly checking the spam folder or having an alternate contact method just in case).</Command> </Commands> <Verification>No major incidents occur because proactive measures are taken. The project remains in a stable condition with known risks under control. For example, spam submissions might be present but at a manageable level, and no legitimate order emails have been lost. The client feels confident that potential issues are being monitored and handled.</Verification> <RollBack>If a risk turns into an issue despite mitigation (e.g., a wave of spam gets through or the email account gets temporarily blocked due to volume), treat it as an incident: resolve the immediate problem (maybe add a CAPTCHA to stop spam, or contact email provider to unblock and then use a more robust SMTP service). After resolution, re-evaluate that risk's mitigation plan to prevent recurrence (perhaps upgrading the spam prevention or splitting notification emails across multiple addresses, etc.). Document the incident and the changes made in the ChangeControl process.</RollBack> </Step> <Step id="6.3.2"> <Task>Process change requests through change control</Task> <OwnerRoles> <Role>Project Manager</Role> <Role>Business Owner</Role> </OwnerRoles> <Commands> <Command>For any new features or major changes post-launch (e.g., adding an order confirmation email to customers, integrating an inventory system, etc.), initiate a formal change request. Log the request with details of the desired change and rationale.</Command> <Command>Analyze the change: the technical team estimates effort and impact. Update the TraceabilityMatrix to map the change to original requirements if relevant (or mark it as a new requirement R12, R13, etc. if beyond original scope). Assess any new risks the change might introduce.</Command> <Command>Seek approval: present the change request and analysis to the Business Owner and any other decision-makers. If the change is approved (and possibly budgeted), schedule it into development. If not, record that decision and revisit later if needed.</Command> <Command>Implement the change following development best practices: use a feature branch, test in staging, and deploy via the established pipeline. Update RACI roles if the change introduces new responsibilities (like if a database is added, maybe a DBA role gets involved). Update all documentation (ArtifactsIndex, Definitions if new terms arise, etc.) accordingly.</Command> <Command>Follow through with testing and deployment as rigorously as the initial launch. Ensure the change does not disrupt existing functionality (regression testing). Only roll out to production once it passes QA and UAT, and get stakeholder sign-off on the change as well.</Command> </Commands> <Verification>All changes after launch are systematically managed. There's a clear record of what changes were made and why, who approved them, and how they were implemented. The system evolves without chaos, and stakeholders have confidence that any enhancements won't compromise the stability achieved at launch. The TraceabilityMatrix can be extended to include these new requirements and their fulfillment steps, ensuring continuity of documentation.</Verification> <RollBack>If a change, once deployed, causes unexpected issues, use the rollback procedures defined: revert to the previous version if needed (the CI/CD can deploy an older commit if we git revert or git checkout a tag). Manage stakeholder expectations through the ChangeControl process: emergency fixes might be needed, which should also go through approval (at least inform the Business Owner). After rollback, reassess the change implementation, adjust the plan, and attempt again when ready, this time with the issues resolved.</RollBack> </Step> </Batch> </Phase> </WorkBreakdown> <RACI> <Task name="Project Initiation (requirements &amp; resourcing)"> <Responsible>Project Manager</Responsible> <Accountable>Business Owner</Accountable> <Consulted>Technical Lead</Consulted> <Informed>Development Team</Informed> </Task> <Task name="Repository Setup &amp; Initial Structure"> <Responsible>DevOps Engineer</Responsible> <Accountable>Technical Lead</Accountable> <Consulted>Front-End Developer</Consulted> <Informed>Project Manager</Informed> </Task> <Task name="Data Integration (Excel &amp; JSON)"> <Responsible>Back-End Developer</Responsible> <Accountable>Technical Lead</Accountable> <Consulted>Content Manager</Consulted> <Informed>Project Manager</Informed> </Task> <Task name="Front-End Development (UI &amp; UX)"> <Responsible>Front-End Developer</Responsible> <Accountable>Technical Lead</Accountable> <Consulted>UX Designer</Consulted> <Informed>Project Manager</Informed> </Task> <Task name="Back-End Development (PHP &amp; Email)"> <Responsible>Back-End Developer</Responsible> <Accountable>Technical Lead</Accountable> <Consulted>Security Engineer</Consulted> <Informed>Project Manager</Informed> </Task> <Task name="CI/CD Setup &amp; Config"> <Responsible>DevOps Engineer</Responsible> <Accountable>Technical Lead</Accountable> <Consulted>Back-End Developer</Consulted> <Informed>Project Manager</Informed> </Task> <Task name="Domain &amp; TLS Configuration"> <Responsible>DevOps Engineer</Responsible> <Accountable>Technical Lead</Accountable> <Consulted>IT Administrator</Consulted> <Informed>Project Manager</Informed> </Task> <Task name="Quality Assurance Testing"> <Responsible>QA Engineer</Responsible> <Accountable>Project Manager</Accountable> <Consulted>Front-End Developer</Consulted> <Informed>Business Owner</Informed> </Task> <Task name="Security Assessment"> <Responsible>Security Engineer</Responsible> <Accountable>Project Manager</Accountable> <Consulted>DevOps Engineer</Consulted> <Informed>Business Owner</Informed> </Task> <Task name="Production Deployment &amp; Launch"> <Responsible>DevOps Engineer</Responsible> <Accountable>Project Manager</Accountable> <Consulted>Business Owner</Consulted> <Informed>Development Team</Informed> </Task> <Task name="Content Updates (Excel data)"> <Responsible>Content Manager</Responsible> <Accountable>Business Owner</Accountable> <Consulted>Back-End Developer</Consulted> <Informed>Project Manager</Informed> </Task> <Task name="Maintenance &amp; Monitoring"> <Responsible>DevOps Engineer</Responsible> <Accountable>Project Manager</Accountable> <Consulted>Security Engineer</Consulted> <Informed>Business Owner</Informed> </Task> <Task name="Change Control Process"> <Responsible>Project Manager</Responsible> <Accountable>Business Owner</Accountable> <Consulted>Technical Lead</Consulted> <Informed>Development Team</Informed> </Task> </RACI> <ArtifactsIndex> <Artifact> <Name>GitHub Repository</Name> <Description>Version-controlled repository containing all source code, data files, and configuration for the project.</Description> <Location>GitHub (private repo named "cannabis-order-dashboard", including /data, /assets, .github/ workflows, etc.)</Location> </Artifact> <Artifact> <Name>LiveMenu.xlsx</Name> <Description>Excel file storing the live product menu data (products, descriptions, prices, etc.), serving as the single source of truth for menu content.</Description> <Location>/data/LiveMenu.xlsx in the repository (deployed on server but protected from public access)</Location> </Artifact> <Artifact> <Name>Generated Menu JSON</Name> <Description>JSON file output by converting LiveMenu.xlsx, used by the front-end to populate the product list dynamically.</Description> <Location>/data/menu.json in the deployed site (rebuilt on each deployment via CI)</Location> </Artifact> <Artifact> <Name>Conversion Script (Node.js)</Name> <Description>Script that reads the Excel file and outputs the JSON (uses SheetJS library).

The requester (client or team member) describes the change and rationale in writing (e.g., via a change request form or GitHub issue).</Step> <Step>Impact Analysis â€“ The technical team assesses the requested change. This includes estimating the effort, identifying affected systems or components, and evaluating potential risks or side-effects. The analysis is documented and attached to the change request.</Step> <Step>Approval â€“ The Project Manager and Business Owner review the change request and impact analysis. They decide whether to approve, defer, or reject the change. Approval is based on value, cost, and alignment with project goals. This step assigns priority and resources if approved.</Step> <Step>Scheduling â€“ Approved changes are scheduled into development cycles or sprints. The Project Manager updates the project timeline and any relevant planning documents. If the change alters scope significantly, a contract addendum or scope change document is prepared and signed off.</Step> <Step>Design & Development â€“ The team designs the solution for the change (update architecture if needed) and implements it. A separate feature branch is used. This stage follows normal development practices (code reviews, unit testing, etc.). The RACI matrix is consulted/updated if new roles are involved for this change.</Step> <Step>Testing â€“ The change is deployed to the staging environment for thorough testing. QA engineers perform regression testing to ensure existing functionality is not broken, and specific testing for the new change. The business owner or users may do UAT on staging to confirm the change meets their needs.</Step> <Step>Deployment â€“ Upon successful testing and UAT sign-off, the change is merged to main and deployed to production via CI/CD. Coordinate the deployment timing (possibly during off-peak hours if the change might cause a brief interruption). Communicate the upcoming change to stakeholders if necessary (especially if user experience will differ).</Step> <Step>Documentation & Training â€“ Update all relevant documents: user guides, this deployment plan (TraceabilityMatrix, ArtifactsIndex if new components), etc., to include the change. Train the client or users on the new feature if needed (even if just via a brief write-up or call explaining whatâ€™s new).</Step> <Step>Post-Implementation Review â€“ After the change is live, monitor it closely. Gather feedback to ensure it's functioning as intended and delivering expected benefits. Document any lessons learned from the change process (for example, if something could have been smoother). Use this knowledge to refine the ChangeControl process for next time.</Step> </Process> <Guidelines>The change control process should be followed for all but trivial changes. Emergency changes (hotfixes) can be expedited (some steps done retroactively), but they should still be documented after the fact. All team members should be aware that unapproved changes are not to be deployed directly. This ensures the system remains stable and that every alteration is tracked and accountable. By adhering to these procedures, the project maintains high quality and stakeholder trust even as it evolves.</Guidelines> </ChangeControl> </Plan>
